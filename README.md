Hackbio 2025 biocoding internship - 

Stage Zero Task -
I used data structure (data.frame) in R to organize the following information of my team members: Names, slack username, email, hobby, countries, discipline & preferred programming language.

Stage One Task - 
1) Write a function for translating DNA to protein
2) Write a function that simulates and generates a logistic population growth curve. Your function should include 2 extra parameters that randomize the length of the lag phase and the exponential phase [See population curve here] . Most living populations follow a logistic population growth. Therefore, your growth curve can be: Population Size vs Time, Cell density vs Time, OD vs Time, CFU vs Time, etc
3) Write a function for determining the time to reach 80% of the maximum growth; usually the carrying capacity
4) Finally, write a function for calculating the hamming distance between your Slack username and twitter/X handle (synthesize if you donâ€™t have one). Feel free to pad it with extra words if they are not of the same length.
